    "description": "LabSound is a Game Boy Advanced music creation project that aims to awaken the artist in all of us. With a design similar to FL Studio or eJay, it allows you to compose your own sound loops, whether or not accompanied by catchy rhythms. Anyone can produce a complete music of about 2-3 min, utilizing the pre-programmed rhythm machine system and add your own melodies or drum sounds over it.",
